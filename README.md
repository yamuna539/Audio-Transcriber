ðŸš€ Everyone builds AI transcription apps in Pythonâ€¦ I decided to do it differently!

I built a Full-Stack AI Audio Transcriber using Java + Spring AI + Gemini API Key â€” and it works seamlessly! ðŸŽ¤

ðŸ’¡ Why this matters:

Most AI projects are Python-based, but Spring AI brings AI directly to the Java ecosystem, making it scalable, enterprise-ready, and easy to integrate.

Transcribe audio instantly â€” MP3, WAV, or lectures â€” saving hours of manual work.

Full-stack solution: Spring Boot backend + React + Vite frontend = fast, responsive, modern UI.

ðŸ”¥ Tech Highlights:

AI-powered transcription pipeline in Java

Inline audio upload handling for small files

Professional, clean, user-friendly interface

Demonstrates how Java developers can leverage AI without switching languages

ðŸ’¬ Why Iâ€™m excited:
This project shows the power of Spring AI and proves that Java can handle AI workloads just as efficiently as Python.
